WDI Success Peptalk
--

Goal: Leave students encouraged and empowered.

** 15 min talk, 15 min QA**

###Intro:

How are you guys doing, how's the first week going?

I talked with Annie this week and we recaped the last WDI program which I was teaching along with Jackie and Anil during the summer. We also reflected on what are some the things that make you successful in the program. She asked me to share our observations with you.

I was thinking I'm going to talk for about 15 min followed by 15 min QandA. 

#####First about me:

- As I said, I tought the summer program.
- Almost 20 years experience working in Silicon Valley, worked in various capacities for anything from small start ups to publicly traded companies. 
- Software Engineer
- System Architect
- CTO
- Wore a few management hats as Director running engineering departments. 

Why am I telling you this? I hired and fired people and I probably interviewed hundreds of candidates from customer service to CEOs.

So I believe I can speak to the real world, what you can epxect and more importantly what other people expect from you when you go out there to find jobs and put your new skills to practice.

###WDI Success factors

But first, you have to complete WDI! 

So what are the things that are going to make you successful? 

It's not neccessarily your IQ. I believe anybody with reasonable amount of intelligence should be able to learn programming skills and use the incredible tools that we have these days, and that you are learning, to build applications. There are other factors in play here that I'd like to talk about.

**Head in the game**. My best advice right off the bat: Don't worry about jobs just yet, focus all your attention and energy on the class, the material, lessons, homework, projects. I think that's absolutely key. Yes, WDI is not the real world, but you have to deal with that soon enough. So make sure your head stays in the game. I understand, it's easy to get distracted: facebook, reddit, emals to check etc - if you can, lay off during class, instead take notes, code along, google releated topics, explore context for what you are learning. **Overlearn**. If you are unsure about the topic/material, ask your teachers. Sometimes it's as easy as "So why are you telling me this?" - ""Why is this important?"  That's 1000 times better than tuning out and getting lost on reddit.

**vs Overwhelmed** On the same note, it's easy to become overwhelmed by everything that you are learning in this short period of time. This feeling of "i'm not getting this". Don't panic, that's a natural phenomenon. I am the first to admit that there's not enough time to let new material sink in and you are probably lucky if you can keep about 50% in your head, particulary in the first three weeks. But keep in mind that there's a lot of repetition thoughout the course. For example you learn about hashes, arrays and loops in Ruby, later you learn how that's done in Javascript, then you learn literally dozens of different ways how to setup and use loops. You will be surprised how concepts find their way into your consciousness and how naturally you'll be able to use them in your projects in the latter part of the program.



Whate else …

Let me tell you a little story.

I'm trying to get one of my students a job at blurb.com and I was talking to Andrew, the head of engineering at blurb about GA and the WDI program. 

Obviously, he's got some skepticism about learning programming in 12 weeks. Is this sufficient time to learn all the tools of the trade? I'm sharing some of that skepticism, but going through the WDI experience as a teacher made me more of a believer. Here's why:

First, 10 years ago I would have said no, but times have changed. There's now an incredebile wealth of information related to coding and software engineering out there. Coding itself has become somewhat of a social activity, you are not a lone warrior anymore. Just think about sites like stackoverflow, github and the open source movement in general.

The willingness to share, help, coorporate is just incredible. I like to say "It has become increasingly more difficult to get stuck". For the things that we are building, the answers are mostly out there, or can be explored and found together. So use your teachers, fellow students, friends to learn, research and build. 

Also, share your findings, publish stuff on github, write a blog, build a portfolio site - I understand you guys are still in the first week, so that's something to start thinking about later in the program, and your teachers will help you with that. Not nexccessarly now, but try to get into that mindset as the program progresses. Make a start by carefully taking notes.

Another thing that I find interesting is that although WDi is focussed on Ruby and Rails and now more and more Javascript, at the end you be come somwhat of a generalist.
We've had many WDI graduates who got Python jobs and did just fine. The program isn't just a "Ruby bootcamp"; it's designed to teach web dev in general, including the ability to transition easily to (and get hired in) other languages. That's why I believe learning the foundation of two programming languages and a web platfrom. In WDI that's Ruby/Rails and Javascript. And yes, sorry, you will have to learn Javascript!
 
** Advice: Share, cooperate, and teach yourself by helping other students **

Then Andrew asked me: ""What makes a successful WDI graduate"" and that's a great question. My first answer was in the negative and I said "Weel, what they don't have is experience", but here's what they've got. And I'm generalizing now but I hope you make some of it your own.

* they are fast learners. For me it's incredible to see some of the final projects of the last class that were build by students who came into the program with no or very little prior knowledge. One of the most gratifying things for me as a teacher was seeing how students surprised themesleves at the end of the program with the stuff they build. And some of them were ready to quit in the first week, but they stuck through it and with incredible results. Looking at those projects, I told Andrew that "I can only imagine where they are in six months, with some mentorship and guidance from more senior engineers."

* they are hungry and highly motivated and they are passionate about building things. I wish I had some of the great ideas you guys have … now you learn the tools to build to make some reality. 

On the same note: Go out and immerse yourself, not only in WDI but in the community, that's actually relatively easy in SF. Go to meetups, talks, company events, conferences … put your ear on the ground: Learn and alo listen. what are people talking about, what are the latest trends, technologies, what are hot topics right now. 5 years ago it was social networks. Well, now it's the Sharing economy, education and clean energy. You have to realize, on a global scale, that you are the first to know! And perhaps you have a chance to shape where things are going. We may take airbnb, lyft and uber for granted but I bet that less than 1% of the population know about, that's how it was with facebook six seven years ago. You are part of the future.

A word for those of you who don't want to become developers but product managers or work in related tech roles. This education is immensly useful. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is working with product managers who:
a) Don't speak the same language (I mean tech)
b) Don't know what's going on, are not up to date on latest trends, best practices, technologies (but rather copy what they see at competitors)

So what you learn at WDI gives you all right tools to talk to your engineers on equal footing (which will also get you a lot of respect, which admittitely is sometimes hard to get from those techies) - plus it will impress your boss in Marketing.

OK, I think that's all I got. What questions do you have?
Anil, Jacky please feel free to chime in. I don't claim to have answers for everything.



####Annie's input

- (a) transition careers to become a full-time permanent web developer
- (b) get a job as a web developer for a couple years to sharpen skills, then transition (back) to something like business or product management where web development experience would be really helpful
- © jump straight (back) into entrepreneurship/product management/something else where web development knowledge would be helpful. Would be awesome to speak to these different groups of students.

Could you say something about how WDI is focused on Ruby but also trains students to be able to pick up other languages (like Python) really easily? We've had many WDI graduates who got Python jobs and did just fine. The program isn't just a "Ruby bootcamp"; it trains them on how to do web development in general, including the ability to transition easily to (and get hired in) other languages.



1) What does success mean, how to quantify?
2) how to get there?



####Attitude, not giving up, continuing to push, confidence

1) How do we measure this goal - concrete, quantifiable way - on a weekly basis, for both students and for us

	- Homework turned in? complete?
	- Not giving up on assignments
	- When called for help: has student tried 	solving on their own? When does student call for help?
	- Willingness to help other students
	- In general, how students talk about program, GA, instructors outside of class, happy hour

2) How do we help them reach success in this goal throughout the course

	- Continue to motivate, alleviate fears
	- Encourage participation in class, call on students?
	- Address attitude issues in one on ones

3) What do we do when students fall behind?

	- Homework: provide best solution, walk through?
	- Saturdays / off-hours review on special topics
	- Make sure code alongs are documented, code is available afterwards
	- Designated note taker?
	
	
####Grit and independence on a daily basis

- Go over goals for the day. Prepare bullet point list of goals. At end of the day, check with class if goals accomplished.

- Look back of what has been accomplished, ask students to notice what they have learned. "Remember where you were just three weeks ago ..."

- Encourage to dig deeper into a subject matter, for example, research/find gem that you think is useful, use it.

- Teach how to research, how to effectively use stackoverflow and google. "Research before asking"



I had one student that had a major in criminology and now he wanted to learn something real, kind of put himself down.
 Well I said awesome, combine engineering with another field. If you are into arts, clean energy, passionate about social causes, or travel - tha't great. combine it 
 
He build an incredible app that combined crime data and craigslist postings  




### Class intro:

I was helping getting a student a job over at blurb whe I know the CTO Andrew.

Then Andrew asked me: ""What makes a successful WDI graduate"" and that's a great question. My first answer was in the negative and I said "Well, what they don't have is experience", but here's what they've got.

* they are curious, devoted
